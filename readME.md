### Additional

Remember that when practicing methods with AXIOS or jQuery to include the script in your HTML document:
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>

- cdn for AXIOS above


    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

- cdn for jQuery above


In the example for jQuery AJAX API method, .getJSON was used- there are other methods with jQuery ( such as: $.ajax, $.get, ...). 

Fetch will not work with InternetExplorer.
